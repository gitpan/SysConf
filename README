SysConf

ABOUT

This module is specifically to enable very simplified access to CentOS/Red Hat
style sysconfig files.  It reads/writes them, provides a simple way to 
create, update, delete keys within these files.  

Primarily it is for ease of munging /etc/sysconfig/* files, and specifically
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* files.


NOTE/WARNING/CAVEAT:

This code does NOT preserve comments in any form.  If you use this module to
process files, those files WILL NOT HAVE ANY COMMENTS IN THEM AFTER IT 
UPDATES THE FILE ON DISK.  So if you document changes in the file via comments
you probably want to be aware of this before you run this module against
the file.


USAGE:


    use SysConf;

    my $sysconf_file   = 'name_of_file';
    my $sysconf_path   = '/etc/sysconfig';
    my $foo = SysConf->new({'file' => $sysconf_file ,'path' => $sysconf_path});
    
    # attach the object to the file
    $foo->attach;
    
    # get a list of all keys in the file (ignore commented ones)
    my @k = $foo->keys;
    
    # set a particular key to a particular value (will insert the key if needed)
    $foo->update('bar'=>1);
    
    # get a particular value given a key
    my $val = $foo->retrieve('oof');
    
    # delete a key/value pair
    my $rv = $foo->delete('bar');
    
    # detach the object from the file
    $foo->detach;
